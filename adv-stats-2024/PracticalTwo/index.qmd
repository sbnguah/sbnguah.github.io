This is the second practical lesson where we learn how to perform exploratory data analysis

## Objectives

- Explore the data
- Summaries
    - Tabulation
    - Measures of central tendency, dispersion, distribution
- Graphics
    - Categorical
        - Barchart
    - Numeric 
        - Histogram, density plot, boxplot, QQplot,  violin plot, 
    - Categorical vs Categorical
        - Barplot
    - Numeric vs numeric
    - Categorical vs Numeric

## To do
### Categorical variable
- We use`titanic.xlsx`
- Statistics
    - Look out for missing
    - One-way tabulation
    - Two-way tabulation
    - Multiple-way tabulation
- Graphics
    - One-way bar plot
    - Two-way bar plot
    
### Numeric variable
- Use "blood.xlsx"
- Statistics – Measure of central tendency
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
- Statistics – measures of dispersion
    - Standard deviation
    - Variance
    - Range
    - IQR
    - Minimum, maximum
- Outliers
- Distribution
    - Skewness
    - Kurtosis
- Normality
- Graphics
    - Histogram
    - Density plot
        - Single
        - Comparative
    - Boxplot
        - Single
    - Comparative
    - Violin plot (+ data points)
        - Single 
        - Comparative

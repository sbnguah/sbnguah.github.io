    "text": "PINGS-2\nThe PINGS-2 (Phone-Based Intervention under Nurse Guidance after Stroke) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial where routine care of patients who had a recent stroke is compared to those who have nursing support in managing their blood pressure after the stroke. Some of the publications emanating from this project are Sarfo et al. (2021)\n\n\n\nPedEcho\nThis is a review of electrocardiograms done in pediatric patients in Kumasi since 2010. It seeks to bring out the common echocardiographic diagnosis and its changing patterns over the years.\n\n\n\nSPARCo\nThe Sickle Pan-African Consortium (SPARCO-II) consists of a hub in East Africa (Tanzania) and collaborative consortium sites in West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria) and Central Africa (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo) which will expand to form the Sickle Pan-African Network involving 20 sites in 15 countries. This consortium is into research involving every aspect of Sickle Cell Disease in both children and adults. Some publications arising from this study include Oppong-Mensah et al.

In the study done at the Child Department of the Tamale Teaching Hospital, children presenting with medical emergencies were recruited. The study done at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital however recruited children with Sickle Cell Disease, Cardiac Pathologies, and those with chronic medical conditions attending the specialist outpatient clinic.

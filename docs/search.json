But when asked, “What’s your research topic?” you freeze like a child…Ouch!.\nChoosing a research topic is often the first real hurdle residents face, not because they lack ideas, but because they have too many, or worse, none that are feasible. This article serves as your guide through the fog, helping you select a topic that’s academically sound, clinically meaningful, and realistically achievable (before retirement)."

    "section": "The Anatomy of a Good Research Topic",
    "text": "The Anatomy of a Good Research Topic\nA good research topic lies at the intersection of interest, relevance, feasibility, and scientific value. Like the classic Venn diagram: if your topic only ticks one or two of these, you’re heading for trouble.\n\nInterest: Pick Something You Genuinely Care About\nYou’re going to spend the next 1–2 years reading, writing, and talking about this topic. If it doesn’t excite you on Day 1, it certainly won’t on Day 201.\n\nExample: If you enjoy neonatology, don’t force yourself into a study on adolescent substance use just because someone said it’s “publishable.”\n\n\n\nRelevance: Will This Matter in Your Context?\nA study on cystic fibrosis might be scientifically rich, but unless you’re in a regional centre with enough cases, it may not be regionally relevant.\nAsk:\n\nDoes this address a common or emerging clinical problem in Ghana or West Africa?\nWill it add value to policy, practice, or further research?\n\nA study on antimicrobial resistance in under-fives with sepsis is both regionally relevant and of public health interest.\n\n\nFeasibility: Do You Have the Time, Data, and Resources?\nAmbition is noble, but so is passing your fellowship. Be wary of multicentre longitudinal studies if you’re juggling night shifts and ward rounds.\n\nTip: Retrospective chart reviews, cross-sectional surveys, short cohort studies, and facility-based studies are often more realistic for a first-time researcher and a fellowship thesis.\n\nA cross-sectional study on asthma control among school-aged children attending your facility? Completely achievable!\nA 10-year follow-up study of post-ICU neurodevelopmental outcomes? Good luck (unless you’ve got funding, a team, and a time machine).\n\n\nScientific Value: What Will the Field Gain?\nAvoid “me-too” topics. A third repetition of “knowledge of neonatal jaundice among caregivers” in the same region, using the same tool, might not break any academic ground, unless you’re adding a novel twist or intervention.\nLook at what’s already published locally and regionally. Use PubMed, African Journals Online (AJOL), and Google Scholar. Embrace Artificial Intelligence if you still have a phobia of it. It will help a lot in this regard.\nConsider:\n\nHas this topic been done before?\nIf yes, can I improve the methodology or explore a different angle?\n\n\n\nMentor Input\nDiscuss with supervisors or clinicians; they can help narrow down and refine your idea."

    "section": "A Practical Scenario",
    "text": "A Practical Scenario\nDr. Ama is a senior paediatric resident at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. She has been working in the Paediatric Emergency Unit and has noticed that many children with severe anaemia are also testing positive for malaria.\nShe begins to wonder:\n\n“Are children with severe anaemia more likely to have malaria, or is this just a coincidence?”\n\n\nStep-by-Step Process to Generate the Topic\n\nStep 1: Observation and Clinical Curiosity\nShe reflects on:\n\nThe frequency of severe anaemia among under-fives.\nThe high malaria burden in the region.\nOccasional delays in diagnosis due to a lack of rapid testing\n\n\nIdea Trigger: There seems to be a link between malaria and anaemia. Can this be studied systematically?\n\n\n\nStep 2: Literature Review\nShe performs a brief search on PubMed, using terms like:\n\n“malaria and anaemia in children in Ghana”\n“prevalence of malaria-induced anaemia”\n“factors associated with severe anaemia”\n\nShe finds:\n\nSeveral studies confirmed the association.\nBut few studies focused on her specific region or were linked to seasonal variations or delays in diagnosis.\n\n\nGap Identified: While malaria–anaemia links are known, there is limited data for her locality, especially regarding the timing of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Discussion with Supervisor or Mentor\nShe shares her thoughts with her supervisor, who responds:\n\n“That’s a good observation. But consider narrowing it. Maybe look at children under 5 years, admitted for anaemia, and determine how many also had malaria by microscopy vs RDT.”\n\n\nRefinement: Supervisor advises to narrow the scope and make it measurable.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Assess Feasibility\nShe considers:\n\nData availability: The Hospital has blood film records, RDT results, and complete blood counts.\nSample size: Over 300 anaemia admissions in the past year.\nTime: She can complete this study in under 12 months.\n\n\nFeasible: Data is available, and ethical clearance is possible.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Define the Research Topic and Objectives\nShe drafts her topic:\n\n“Prevalence And Seasonal Trend of Malaria in Children Under 5 Years Admitted with Anaemia at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital”\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo determine the proportion of anemic children under five who test positive for malaria.\nTo compare the diagnostic yield between RDT and blood film microscopy.\nTo explore seasonal trends in malaria-associated anaemia.\n\n\n\nFinal Research Topic (SMART)\n\n“Malaria Infection Among Children Under Five Years Admitted With Anaemia at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Study”\n\n\nSpecific – children &lt;5 with anaemia.\nMeasurable – malaria test results.\nAchievable – uses existing data.\nRelevant – targets a major child health problem.\nTime-bound – single hospital, defined period.\n\nMission Accomplished (Without any spy gadgets!) 🥷🥷🥷"

    "text": "Introduction\nResearch often evokes images of laboratories, statistics, and long journal articles. For many paediatric trainees, it is viewed as a necessary obstacle, the “thesis you must do” before completing the fellowship program. However, research is much more than just a requirement; it is an essential part of clinical excellence. In a region like West Africa, where context-specific evidence is often missing, research becomes a tool not only for learning but also for leading.\nEvery time you question a treatment outcome, observe a recurring clinical pattern, or wonder how to improve your service delivery, you are engaging in the curiosity that drives research. This article aims to help you understand why research should matter deeply to you as a pediatrician-in-training, and how it can shape your future practice."

    "section": "Why Should You Care About Research?",
    "text": "Why Should You Care About Research?\n\nResearch Builds Better Clinicians\nContrary to popular belief, research is not the opposite of clinical work; it enhances it. Clinicians who engage with research develop sharper critical thinking skills. They are more likely to read journals analytically, question clinical practices, and make evidence-informed decisions. In a world where medical misinformation spreads easily, the ability to discern good evidence from poor-quality studies is a vital professional skill.\n\n\nOur Questions Deserve Local Answers\nMost of the evidence that guides paediatric practice worldwide comes from high-income countries. While this knowledge is valuable, it often doesn’t reflect the realities of African healthcare systems: different pathogens, resource limitations, or cultural barriers to care. Only locally generated research can tell us, for example, the actual burden of neonatal jaundice in our setting or the best way to manage asthma in a rural clinic with limited drug availability. Your research as a fellow is not just an academic exercise; it’s an opportunity to contribute to a much-needed evidence base that reflects our unique realities.\n\n\nResearch Amplifies Your Voice\nMany paediatricians are passionate advocates for children but feel limited to bedside interventions. Research offers a path to broader influence. When your study is published or presented, it enters the professional and policy-making space. Your findings could contribute to national guidelines, influence donor priorities, or inform training curricula. In this way, research transforms your observations into advocacy backed by data.\n\n\nIt Opens Doors You Never Expected\nWhether it’s a travel grant to present at an international conference, a collaboration with a regional team, or an opportunity to lead a quality improvement project, research creates visibility. It builds your academic profile and sets you apart as someone who doesn’t just follow the evidence but helps generate it."

The rest is teachable.\nOver the next several weeks, a blog will be written and shared each week. It is hoped that the series will guide you through the research process with practical steps, from choosing a topic and designing a study to analyzing data and publishing. Research isn’t as intimidating as it seems, but it’s a journey you can take one step at a time. Each blog focuses on a small part of this process, keeping reading time under 10 minutes. This isn’t just about finishing your fellowship thesis but about shaping your career, improving child health, and advancing the practice of medicine in West Africa.\nWelcome to your research year.

Now comes the part that makes many residents sigh, scroll endlessly through PubMed, and whisper to themselves, “Wasn’t this supposed to be the easy part?” Yes, dear reader, it’s time to tackle the literature review.\nThe literature review is the foundation upon which your proposal rests. It demonstrates that you know what’s been done, what’s missing, and why your study is necessary. Think of it as your opportunity to show the assessors that you didn’t wake up one morning and decide to study “something interesting.” Rather, you’ve surveyed the landscape, identified the gaps, and are now ready to build something meaningful on that ground."

    "text": "A Sample Introduction…\nTitle: Predictors of Mortality in Severe Malaria in Children Under Five Years in Kumasi, Ghana\nMalaria continues to be a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2022, an estimated 247 million cases of malaria occurred globally, resulting in 619,000 deaths, with children under five years accounting for nearly 80% of these deaths (WHO, 2023). Sub-Saharan Africa bears the greatest burden, contributing approximately 94% of global malaria cases and deaths.\nIn Ghana, malaria remains the number one cause of outpatient attendance and childhood hospital admissions, with under-five mortality rates still heavily influenced by this preventable disease. Severe malaria, characterized by complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anaemia, and respiratory distress, is associated with particularly high mortality when not promptly managed. At Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, severe malaria cases are frequently admitted to paediatric emergency and intensive care units, with outcomes varying depending on clinical and laboratory factors.\nSeveral studies across Africa have identified predictors of mortality in severe malaria, including hypoglycaemia, delayed presentation, cerebral involvement, and co-morbid infections (Idro et al., 2010; Olumese et al., 2019). However, there is limited data from Ghana, particularly in Kumasi, on which factors most strongly predict mortality in children with severe malaria. Understanding these predictors in the local context is essential for improving triage protocols, guiding resource allocation, and ultimately reducing mortality.\nThis study, therefore, seeks to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality among children under five years admitted with severe malaria at KATH. The findings will contribute evidence to support more targeted interventions and enhance early recognition of high-risk patients in Ghanaian hospitals.\nBingo!!! There you have it. 😎😎😎"

So, let us dissect it!\n\nPopulation (P)\nBe specific. Instead of “children,” say “children under five presenting to the Paediatric Emergency Unit at Korle Bu.”\n👉 Bad: “Does asthma affect children?”\n👉 Better: “Among school-aged children in Accra…”\n\n\nIntervention (I)\nThis could be a treatment, risk factor, diagnostic test, or exposure.\n👉 Example: “Use of inhaled corticosteroids” or “exclusive breastfeeding.”\n\n\nComparison (C)\nSometimes optional, but always helpful. What’s the alternative? Placebo? No treatment? Standard practice?\n👉 Example: “Inhaled corticosteroids vs. short-acting beta agonists alone.”\n\n\nOutcome (O)\nThis should be measurable, not vague. Avoid “improved health.” Think: “reduction in asthma exacerbations,” “increase in haemoglobin levels,” or “improved growth velocity.” These are specific and measurable!\n\n\nTime (T)\nAlthough not always necessary, it adds clarity.\n👉 Example: “Over a six-month follow-up.”"

For many paediatric trainees, it is viewed as a necessary obstacle, the “thesis you must do” before completing the fellowship program. However, research is much more than just a requirement; it is an essential part of clinical excellence. In a region like West Africa, where context-specific evidence is often missing, research becomes a tool not only for learning but also for leading.\nEvery time you question a treatment outcome, observe a recurring clinical pattern, or wonder how to improve your service delivery, you are engaging in the curiosity that drives research.

    "text": "Why Should You Care About Research?\n\nResearch Builds Better Clinicians\nContrary to popular belief, research is not the opposite of clinical work; it enhances it. Clinicians who engage with research develop sharper critical thinking skills. They are more likely to read journals analytically, question clinical practices, and make evidence-informed decisions. In a world where medical misinformation spreads easily, the ability to discern good evidence from poor-quality studies is a vital professional skill.\n\n\nOur Questions Deserve Local Answers\nMost of the evidence that guides paediatric practice worldwide comes from high-income countries. While this knowledge is valuable, it often doesn’t reflect the realities of African healthcare systems: different pathogens, resource limitations, or cultural barriers to care. Only locally generated research can tell us, for example, the actual burden of neonatal jaundice in our setting or the best way to manage asthma in a rural clinic with limited drug availability. Your research as a fellow is not just an academic exercise; it’s an opportunity to contribute to a much-needed evidence base that reflects our unique realities.\n\n\nResearch Amplifies Your Voice\nMany paediatricians are passionate advocates for children but feel limited to bedside interventions. Research offers a path to broader influence. When your study is published or presented, it enters the professional and policy-making space. Your findings could contribute to national guidelines, influence donor priorities, or inform training curricula. In this way, research transforms your observations into advocacy backed by data.\n\n\nIt Opens Doors You Never Expected\nWhether it’s a travel grant to present at an international conference, a collaboration with a regional team, or an opportunity to lead a quality improvement project, research creates visibility. It builds your academic profile and sets you apart as someone who doesn’t just follow the evidence but helps generate it."

Today, let’s take a detour into a common headache senior residents face: What to do when your study population is small.\nIn clinical research, we are taught that bigger is better. Larger sample sizes reduce error, increase statistical power, and make our findings more generalisable. But in the real world of paediatric research, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, we sometimes have to make do with small numbers. Rare conditions, resource limitations, or the simple reality of being a resident with a short training window can leave you staring at an Excel sheet with only 30 rows of data. Does this mean your study is doomed? Not at all. Small studies can still be rigorous, meaningful, and presentable in a fellowship thesis, if analysed and presented wisely. Let’s explore how to handle such data without losing credibility (or your sanity!)."

    "text": "What To Do…\n\nAcknowledge the Limitations Upfront\nThe first rule of small sample size is honesty. You must clearly acknowledge that your study may lack statistical power and may be prone to Type II error (false negatives). This doesn’t invalidate the study, but it helps set expectations for reviewers and examiners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet This!\n\n\n\nIf you study neuroblastoma cases in a single centre and only get 28 eligible patients, that is not a weakness; it reflects the rarity of the condition.\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics are Your Best Friend\nWhen numbers are small, the data itself deserves to be shown. The general advice is:\n\nUse tables and graphs generously, as showing detail is the hallmark of reporting on small data.\nUse Counts and Percentages for categorical variables.\nUse Median and interquartile ranges (IQR) rather than means and standard deviations for continuous variables.\nWhen using figures, it’s better to use graphs that display individual data points, such as dotplots (@fig-three), scatterplots (Figure 1), boxplots with jitter (Figure 2), but not histograms."

    "section": "Tip",
    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid drowning in percentages that exaggerate minor differences. Saying “2 out of 5 children (40%) could look way smaller in percentage terms compared to”3 out of 5 (60%)” when the numeric difference is only one!\n\n\n\nChoose Statistical Tests Carefully\nMany tests assume large samples and normal distributions. With a small sample size, those assumptions may not hold. Consider:\n\nNon-parametric tests:\n\nMann–Whitney U test instead of the t-test.\nFisher’s exact test instead of chi-square (especially when expected counts &lt;5).\n\nExact methods: Some software allows exact p-values that are valid for small samples.\nEffect sizes and confidence intervals: Even if p-values are non-significant, reporting effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios with wide CIs) is valuable.\nMultivariate regression has become an integral part of most fellowship theses, but it is not your friend when the sample size is small. Instead, discuss with your statistician if there is a need for regression. If so, a parsimonious approach is usually required, where not more than two covariates are included in the regression at a time. Alternative regression approaches are Penalized or Exact logistic regression. None of these, however, permits one to present the data as confirmatory and not exploratory.\nOther statistical analysis approaches may involve Bayesian methods, Simulation, and Bootstrapping. These are surely beyond the scope of this text.\n\nYes, I know. Statistics always makes you feel that cringe in your tummy, but hallelujah, you are still reading. 😃😃\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatter plot showing individual points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Boxplot with points shown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Dotplot with points shown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on Clinical Significance, Not Just p-values\nWith a small sample, statistical significance may be elusive. But clinical importance can still be evident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nImagine you are comparing two treatments for severe malaria. Out of 30 children, mortality was 4/15 in group A and 1/15 in group B. The Fisher’s exact test may not reach statistical significance. However, a relative risk of 0.25 is clinically meaningful and worth reporting with its often large confidence interval, with a note on limited power.\n\n\n\n\nUse Visual Storytelling\nGraphs are particularly powerful in small datasets. Consider:\n\nDot plots or scatterplots: Show every patient, highlighting the individuality of small data (Figure 1).\nBox-and-whisker plots: To summarise distributions while showing variability. (Figure 2)\nLine plots: For repeated measures (e.g., weight or haemoglobin before and after intervention).\n\nA simple, clean figure often speaks louder than a complex p-value.\n\n\nBe Transparent in Reporting\nTransparency builds trust. Always report:\n\nThe actual numerator and denominator (“7 out of 30”), not just percentages.\nAny missing data and how you handled them.\nWhether you used one-tailed or two-tailed tests (this will be explained in subsequent blogs).\n\nReviewers are less likely to criticise your small sample if you show integrity in how you present it."

    "text": "The Anatomy of a Good Research Topic\nA good research topic lies at the intersection of interest, relevance, feasibility, and scientific value. Like the classic Venn diagram: if your topic only ticks one or two of these, you’re heading for trouble.\n\nInterest: Pick Something You Genuinely Care About\nYou’re going to spend the next 1–2 years reading, writing, and talking about this topic. If it doesn’t excite you on Day 1, it certainly won’t on Day 201.\n\nExample: If you enjoy neonatology, don’t force yourself into a study on adolescent substance use just because someone said it’s “publishable.”\n\n\n\nRelevance: Will This Matter in Your Context?\nA study on cystic fibrosis might be scientifically rich, but unless you’re in a regional centre with enough cases, it may not be regionally relevant.\nAsk:\n\nDoes this address a common or emerging clinical problem in Ghana or West Africa?\nWill it add value to policy, practice, or further research?\n\nA study on antimicrobial resistance in under-fives with sepsis is both regionally relevant and of public health interest.\n\n\nFeasibility: Do You Have the Time, Data, and Resources?\nAmbition is noble, but so is passing your fellowship. Be wary of multicentre longitudinal studies if you’re juggling night shifts and ward rounds.\n\nTip: Retrospective chart reviews, cross-sectional surveys, short cohort studies, and facility-based studies are often more realistic for a first-time researcher and a fellowship thesis.\n\nA cross-sectional study on asthma control among school-aged children attending your facility? Completely achievable!\nA 10-year follow-up study of post-ICU neurodevelopmental outcomes? Good luck! (unless you’ve got funding, a team, and a time machine).\n\n\nScientific Value: What Will the Field Gain?\nAvoid “me-too” topics. A third repetition of “knowledge of neonatal jaundice among caregivers” in the same region, using the same tool, might not break any academic ground, unless you’re adding a novel twist or intervention.\nLook at what’s already published locally and regionally. Use PubMed, African Journals Online (AJOL), and Google Scholar. Embrace Artificial Intelligence if you still have a phobia of it. It will help a lot in this regard.\nConsider:\n\nHas this topic been done before?\nIf yes, can I improve the methodology or explore a different angle?\n\n\n\nMentor Input\nDiscuss with supervisors or clinicians; they can help narrow down and refine your idea."

    "text": "A Practical Scenario\nDr. Ama is a senior paediatric resident at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. She has been working in the Paediatric Emergency Unit and has noticed that many children with severe anaemia are also testing positive for malaria.\nShe begins to wonder:\n\n“Are children with severe anaemia more likely to have malaria, or is this just a coincidence?”\n\n\nStep-by-Step Process to Generate the Topic\n\nStep 1: Observation and Clinical Curiosity\nShe reflects on:\n\nThe frequency of severe anaemia among under-fives.\nThe high malaria burden in the region.\nOccasional delays in diagnosis due to a lack of rapid testing\n\n\nIdea Trigger: There seems to be a link between malaria and anaemia. Can this be studied systematically?\n\n\n\nStep 2: Literature Review\nShe performs a brief search on PubMed, using terms like:\n\n“malaria and anaemia in children in Ghana”\n“prevalence of malaria-induced anaemia”\n“factors associated with severe anaemia”\n\nShe finds:\n\nSeveral studies confirmed the association.\nBut few studies focused on her specific region or were linked to seasonal variations or delays in diagnosis.\n\n\nGap Identified: While malaria–anaemia links are known, there is limited data for her locality, especially regarding the timing of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Discussion with Supervisor or Mentor\nShe shares her thoughts with her supervisor, who responds:\n\n“That’s a good observation. But consider narrowing it. Maybe look at children under 5 years, admitted for anaemia, and determine how many also had malaria by microscopy vs RDT.”\n\n\nRefinement: Supervisor advises to narrow the scope and make it measurable.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Assess Feasibility\nShe considers:\n\nData availability: The Hospital has blood film records, RDT results, and complete blood counts.\nSample size: Over 300 anaemia admissions in the past year.\nTime: She can complete this study in under 12 months.\n\n\nFeasible: Data is available, and ethical clearance is possible.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Define the Research Topic and Objectives\nShe drafts her topic:\n\n“Prevalence And Seasonal Trend of Malaria in Children Under 5 Years Admitted with Anaemia at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital”\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo determine the proportion of anemic children under five who test positive for malaria.\nTo compare the diagnostic yield between RDT and blood film microscopy.\nTo explore seasonal trends in malaria-associated anaemia.\n\n\n\nFinal Research Topic (SMART)\n\n“Malaria Infection Among Children Under Five Years Admitted With Anaemia at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Study”\n\nA careful observation of this title reveals the following qualities:\n\nSpecific – children &lt;5 with anaemia.\nMeasurable – malaria test results.\nAchievable – uses existing data.\nRelevant – targets a major child health problem.\nTime-bound – single hospital, defined period.\n\nMission Accomplished (Without any spy gadgets!) 🥷🥷🥷"

It could be a puzzling observation on the ward, a nagging pattern in the outpatient clinic, or a burning question whispered during mortality meetings. But in academia, and especially in WACP and GCPS fellowship training, ideas alone are not currency. An idea without a proposal is like a recipe without ingredients: impressive-sounding, but you’ll never get fed.\nA research proposal is your way of showing examiners, supervisors, and colleagues that you can transform curiosity into credible science. It is not simply “a hurdle before Part II.” It serves as your training ground for grant applications, collaborative projects, and the broader research world. If you can write a good fellowship proposal, you’re well on your way to writing protocols for WHO, UNICEF, or your Ministry of Health. And let’s be honest: it’s also your ticket to surviving rounds of corrections from…"

Set the stage with local data, link to global literature, and highlight the gap. WACP allows 300 words; GCPS gives you more room, but don’t waste it with unnecessary storytelling.\n\n\nObjectives & Research Questions\nThese must flow logically from your rationale.

A well-done review shows you understand what has been studied, where gaps remain, and how your project adds value. Both Colleges insist on African literature. Use recent published sources but also cite local theses and regional studies (Wong et al., 2021; PMID: 33486548).\n\n\nMethods\nThis is the beating heart of your proposal. Define:\n- Study design (cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, clinical trial)\n- Population, inclusion/exclusion criteria\n- Sampling strategy\n- Sample size (with justification; examiners love formulas!)\n- Data collection tools\n- Data management and analysis plan\nA good rule: if someone else reads your methods, they should be able to repeat your study without calling you at midnight.\n\n\nEthics\nBoth Colleges want assurance that you will not traumatise children, breach confidentiality, or overburden parents. Always name the ethics committee you applied to. Mention informed consent/assent, confidentiality, and data protection.\n\n\nRelevance\nWACP caps this at 200 words. Don’t just say “It will help children.” Be specific: “Findings will guide policy on asthma management in Ghana and provide baseline data for future multicentre studies.”\n\n\nBudget, Timeline, and Logistics\nOnly GCPS explicitly requires these, but don’t ignore them for WACP.

Where is the African or Ghanaian data?”\nFor example, saying, “Malaria causes over 400,000 deaths annually worldwide,” is fine, but it doesn’t prove why you should do a study in Kumasi. A stronger argument is: “Despite Ghana’s malaria control strategies, the case fatality rate among children under five admitted with severe malaria at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital remains above the national target.” Now you have global importance and local urgency.\nBoth WACP and GCPS explicitly ask you to cite African literature for this reason.

Despite improvements in malaria control strategies, case fatality rates remain unacceptably high at tertiary hospitals, particularly in resource-limited settings such as Kumasi. Identifying predictors of mortality in severe malaria is crucial for improving early recognition of high-risk children and guiding timely interventions that may save lives.\nSeveral studies in East Africa have reported factors associated with poor outcomes in severe malaria, including cerebral involvement, severe anaemia, and delayed presentation. However, few studies have comprehensively examined these predictors in Ghana, and none have specifically focused on Kumasi. Given the regional variations in clinical presentations and health system capacities, local data are urgently needed.\nThis study will generate evidence directly relevant to clinical care in Kumasi. By identifying the predictors of mortality among children under five with severe malaria, it can inform the development of locally adapted triage tools and management protocols. The findings may also serve as a baseline for evaluating future interventions and contribute to national strategies aimed at reducing under-five mortality. Ultimately, the study’s impact extends beyond academic fulfilment — it can help save lives."

    "text": "In Summary…\nA hypothesis is your study’s backbone. It transforms curiosity into a testable, measurable statement. Good hypotheses are clear, specific, and rooted in literature. They come in pairs (null and alternative) and directly map onto your objectives.\nWithout one, your study risks becoming a fishing expedition in the data ocean, lots of activity, very little catch. With a solid hypothesis, you set yourself up for meaningful findings, whether your results surprise you or confirm your expectations."

So, write it boldly, test it carefully, and let the data speak.\nSee you next week, and may your null hypothesis be rejected only when it truly deserves it!"

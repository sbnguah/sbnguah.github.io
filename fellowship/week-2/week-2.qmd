*‚ÄúChoosing a thesis topic is like choosing a life partner: go with just good looks (or trendiness),
and you might suffer for years.‚Äù*

## Recap‚Ä¶

Last week, we agreed that research isn't just an academic checkbox; it‚Äôs a professional tool that
lets paediatricians shape care beyond the clinic. Now, let‚Äôs move from **why** research matters to
**how** to begin it, with the right topic.

## Introduction

So, you‚Äôre ready to start your thesis. You have your white coat, a stethoscope, and enough caffeine
to power a minor city. But when asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your research topic?‚Äù you freeze like a child caught
with biscuit crumbs on their face.

Choosing a research topic is often the first real hurdle residents face, not because they lack
ideas, but because they **have too many**, or worse, **none that are feasible**. This article serves
as your guide through the fog, helping you select a topic that‚Äôs academically sound, clinically
meaningful, and realistically achievable (before retirement).

## The Anatomy of a Good Research Topic

A good research topic lies at the intersection of *interest*, *relevance*, *feasibility*, and
*scientific value*. Like the classic Venn diagram: if your topic only ticks one or two of these,
you‚Äôre heading for trouble.

### Interest: Pick Something You Genuinely Care About

You‚Äôre going to spend the next 1‚Äì2 years reading, writing, and talking about this topic. If it
doesn‚Äôt excite you on Day 1, it certainly won‚Äôt on Day 201.

> **Example:** If you enjoy neonatology, don‚Äôt force yourself into a study on adolescent substance
> use just because someone said it‚Äôs ‚Äúpublishable.‚Äù

### Relevance: Will This Matter in Your Context?

A study on cystic fibrosis might be scientifically rich, but unless you‚Äôre in a regional centre with
enough cases, it may not be regionally relevant.

Ask:

-   Does this address a common or emerging clinical problem in Ghana or West Africa?
-   Will it add value to policy, practice, or further research?

A study on antimicrobial resistance in under-fives with sepsis is both regionally relevant and of
public health interest.

### Feasibility: Do You Have the Time, Data, and Resources?

Ambition is noble, but so is passing your fellowship. Be wary of multicentre longitudinal studies if
you‚Äôre juggling night shifts and ward rounds.

> **Tip**: Retrospective chart reviews, cross-sectional surveys, short cohort studies, and
> facility-based studies are often more realistic for a first-time researcher and a fellowship
> thesis.

A cross-sectional study on asthma control among school-aged children attending your facility?
Completely achievable!

A 10-year follow-up study of post-ICU neurodevelopmental outcomes? Good luck (unless you‚Äôve got
funding, a team, and a time machine).

### Scientific Value: What Will the Field Gain?

Avoid ‚Äúme-too‚Äù topics. A third repetition of ‚Äú*knowledge of neonatal jaundice among caregivers*‚Äù in
the same region, using the same tool, might not break any academic ground, unless you‚Äôre adding a
novel twist or intervention.

Look at what‚Äôs already published locally and regionally. Use **PubMed**, **African Journals Online
(AJOL)**, and **Google Scholar**. Embrace Artificial Intelligence if you still have a phobia of it.
It will help a lot in this regard.

Consider:

-   Has this topic been done before?
-   If yes, can I improve the methodology or explore a different angle?

### Mentor Input

Discuss with supervisors or clinicians; they can help narrow down and refine your idea.

## Where Do Good Topics Come From?

-   **Clinical Curiosity:** Something you‚Äôve noticed during your rotations.
-   **Literature Gaps:** Unanswered questions in recent journal articles.
-   **Supervisors & Mentors:** Tap into their experience (and sometimes their data!).
-   **National Priorities:** Align with ongoing health strategies or WHO/Ministry reports
-   **Your Audit Book:** That intriguing trend you found during clinical audit might just be
    publishable!

For instance, if you observed that most neonates with jaundice are presenting late despite antenatal
education, that‚Äôs a question worth studying.

## Red Flags To Avoid

-   Topics that are too broad (‚ÄúNutrition in children‚Äù)
-   Topics driven only by data availability (Don‚Äôt reverse-engineer research just because you have a
    dusty folder of lab results)
-   ‚ÄúHot‚Äù topics outside your scope (E.g., Machine learning in NICUs‚Ä¶ unless you have the team and
    tech)
-   Anything dependent on ‚Äúpending‚Äù funding or ethics approval from 4 hospitals

## A Practical Scenario

Dr. Ama is a senior paediatric resident at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. She has been working
in the Paediatric Emergency Unit and has noticed that many children with s**evere anaemia** are also
testing **positive for malaria**.

She begins to wonder:

> "Are children with severe anaemia more likely to have malaria, or is this just a coincidence?"

### Step-by-Step Process to Generate the Topic

#### **Step 1**: Observation and Clinical Curiosity

She reflects on:

-   The frequency of **severe anaemia** among under-fives.
-   The high **malaria burden** in the region.
-   Occasional **delays in diagnosis** due to a lack of rapid testing

> **Idea Trigger**: There seems to be a link between malaria and anaemia. Can this be studied
> systematically?

#### **Step 2**: Literature Review

She performs a brief search on **PubMed**, using terms like:

-   *"malaria and anaemia in children in Ghana"*
-   *"prevalence of malaria-induced anaemia"*
-   *"factors associated with severe anaemia"*

She finds:

-   Several studies confirmed the association.
-   But few studies focused on her specific region or were linked to seasonal variations or delays
    in diagnosis.

> **Gap Identified**: While malaria‚Äìanaemia links are known, there is limited data for her locality,
> especially regarding the timing of diagnosis and treatment.

#### **Step 3:** Discussion with Supervisor or Mentor

She shares her thoughts with her supervisor, who responds:

-   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good observation. But consider narrowing it. Maybe look at children under 5 years,
    admitted for anaemia, and determine how many also had malaria by **microscopy vs RDT**.‚Äù

> **Refinement**: Supervisor advises to narrow the scope and make it measurable.

#### **Step 4:** Assess Feasibility

She considers:

-   **Data availability**: The Hospital has blood film records, RDT results, and complete blood
    counts.
-   **Sample size**: Over 300 anaemia admissions in the past year.
-   **Time:** She can complete this study in under 12 months.

> **Feasible**: Data is available, and ethical clearance is possible.

#### **Step 5:** Define the Research Topic and Objectives

She drafts her topic:

> **"Prevalence And Seasonal Trend of Malaria in Children Under 5 Years Admitted with Anaemia at
> Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital"**

Objectives:

1.  To determine the proportion of anemic children under five who test positive for malaria.
2.  To compare the diagnostic yield between RDT and blood film microscopy.
3.  To explore seasonal trends in malaria-associated anaemia.

#### **Final Research Topic (SMART)**

> **‚ÄúMalaria Infection Among Children Under Five Years Admitted With Anaemia at Komfo Anokye
> Teaching Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Study‚Äù**

-   **Specific** ‚Äì children \<5 with anaemia.
-   **Measurable** ‚Äì malaria test results.
-   **Achievable** ‚Äì uses existing data.
-   **Relevant** ‚Äì targets a major child health problem.
-   **Time-bound** ‚Äì single hospital, defined period.

Mission Accomplished (Without any spy gadgets!) **ü•∑ü•∑ü•∑**

## Summary

Choosing a research topic is not just the first step; it‚Äôs a foundational one. Don‚Äôt rush it. Be
guided by:

-   What you care about
-   What‚Äôs relevant to your training and region
-   What you can complete within your time and resources
-   What adds a meaningful contribution to paediatric care

## Take-Home Message

Your thesis topic doesn‚Äôt need to cure cancer, but it should be clear, focused, answerable, and
worth reading (without inducing seizures).

## Next Week on Paediatric Research Insights‚Ä¶

We‚Äôll turn your chosen topic into a research question that gets your supervisor nodding and your
ethics committee smiling (or at least not frowning). See you next week! üëãüèæ

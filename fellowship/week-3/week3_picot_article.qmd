**‚ÄúWisdom is like a baobab tree; no one individual can embrace it.‚Äù**

## Recap...

Last week, we discovered that your thesis topic doesn‚Äôt need to cure cancer, but it should be clear,
focused, answerable, and worth reading. This week, we explore the process of developing a research
question that evokes happiness, even in the most depressed skeptic.

## Introduction

A research question is the backbone of your thesis. Get it wrong, and you‚Äôll limp through the entire
process. Get it right, and everything else, from your design to your discussion, flows naturally.

The challenge? Many residents start with vague questions like:

1.  ‚ÄúDoes malaria affect children?‚Äù (Spoiler: yes, it does.)
2.  ‚ÄúWhat is the effect of malnutrition?‚Äù (On what? Whom? When?)

This is where **PICOT** comes in. It is not a fancy Italian coffee, but a tool to keep your research
question structured, sharp, and answerable. Let us dive into it...

## The PICOT Framework Explained

PICOT stands for:\
**P ‚Äì Population**: Who are you studying?\
**I ‚Äì Intervention (or exposure)**: What‚Äôs being applied, tested, or observed?\
**C ‚Äì Comparison**: What are you comparing it against (if applicable)?\
**O ‚Äì Outcome**: What measurable effect are you interested in?\
**T ‚Äì Time**: Over what period?

Together, these elements transform a loose idea into a focused, researchable question. So, let us
dissect it!

### Population (P)

Be specific. Instead of ‚Äúchildren,‚Äù say ‚Äúchildren under five presenting to the Paediatric Emergency
Unit at Korle Bu.‚Äù

üëâ Bad: ‚ÄúDoes asthma affect children?‚Äù\
üëâ Better: ‚ÄúAmong school-aged children in Accra‚Ä¶‚Äù

### Intervention (I)

This could be a treatment, risk factor, diagnostic test, or exposure.

üëâ Example: ‚ÄúUse of inhaled corticosteroids‚Äù or ‚Äúexclusive breastfeeding.‚Äù

### Comparison (C)

Sometimes optional, but always helpful. What‚Äôs the alternative? Placebo? No treatment? Standard
practice?

üëâ Example: ‚Äú**Inhaled corticosteroids** vs. **short-acting beta agonists alone**.‚Äù

### Outcome (O)

This should be measurable, not vague. Avoid ‚Äúimproved health.‚Äù Think: ‚Äúreduction in asthma
exacerbations,‚Äù ‚Äúincrease in haemoglobin levels,‚Äù or ‚Äúimproved growth velocity.‚Äù These are specific
and measurable!

### Time (T)

Although not always necessary, it adds clarity.\
üëâ Example: ‚ÄúOver a six-month follow-up.‚Äù

## Putting It All Together: From Vague to Vivid

Let‚Äôs walk through a paediatric example.

-   **Vague Question**: ‚ÄúDoes breastfeeding help babies?‚Äù
-   **PICOT Question**: ‚ÄúAmong infants less than 6 months old in Kumasi (**P)**, does exclusive
    breastfeeding for the first 6 months (**I)**, compared to mixed feeding (**C**), reduce the
    incidence of diarrhoeal diseases (**O**) during infancy **(T**)?‚Äù

See the difference? One belongs in a WhatsApp chat, the other belongs in your thesis protocol.

## Why PICOT Matters

1.  **Guides Study Design**: Your question dictates whether you run a cross-sectional survey, a
    cohort study, or a clinical trial.
2.  **Clarifies Variables**: No more mid-thesis panic when you realise you never defined your
    outcome.
3.  **Keeps You Focused**: With PICOT, you avoid drifting into irrelevant territory.
4.  **Impresses Examiners**: A well-structured question signals a well-prepared candidate.

> A 2010 review highlighted that structured research questions using PICOT were associated with
> stronger study design and more transparent reporting (Richardson et al., 1995; Huang et al.,
> 2006).

## Summary

The PICOT framework is your thesis compass. It ensures your research question is not only
straightforward but also **doable**. By explicitly defining the **who, what, compared to what,
expected result, and timeframe**, you‚Äôll save yourself headaches later on.

## Take-Home Message

Never write a research question that could be answered with a shrug. With PICOT, your question
becomes focused, measurable, and worthy of a fellowship thesis.

## Next Week on Paediatric Research Insights‚Ä¶

We‚Äôll dissect the **‚Äú***Anatomy of a Good Research Proposal***‚Äù**, think of it as the skeletal
system of your thesis, without which your research collapses like a jellyfish.

Until then, may your research questions be sharp, your supervisors impressed, and your comparison
groups cooperative. See you next week...bring your skeleton key! ü¶¥üìö

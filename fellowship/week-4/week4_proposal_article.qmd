***‚ÄúHe who does not know one thing knows another.‚Äù***

## Recap...

Last week, we discovered that a strong research question is like a stool: PICOT gives it the five
legs it needs to stand. Today, we‚Äôll learn how to weave that stool into a proposal sturdy enough to
carry examiners.

## Introduction

Every researcher has that ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment. It could be a puzzling observation on the ward, a nagging
pattern in the outpatient clinic, or a burning question whispered during mortality meetings. But in
academia, and especially in **WACP and GCPS fellowship training**, ideas alone are not currency. An
idea without a proposal is like a recipe without ingredients: impressive-sounding, but you‚Äôll never
get fed.

A **research proposal** is your way of showing examiners, supervisors, and colleagues that you can
transform curiosity into credible science. It is not simply ‚Äúa hurdle before Part II.‚Äù It serves as
your training ground for grant applications, collaborative projects, and the broader research world.
If you can write a good fellowship proposal, you‚Äôre well on your way to writing protocols for WHO,
UNICEF, or your Ministry of Health. And let‚Äôs be honest: it‚Äôs also your ticket to surviving rounds
of corrections from...

## The Purpose of a Proposal

Think of your proposal as a **map, contract, and sales pitch rolled into one**.

-   As a **map**, it guides your steps from idea to data collection to final write-up.
-   As a **contract**, it sets boundaries: no ‚Äúmission creep,‚Äù no reinventing the wheel halfway.
-   As a **sales pitch**, it convinces examiners and supervisors that your study is feasible,
    ethical, and essential.

Without a proposal, you‚Äôre like a surgeon walking into the theatre without instruments;
enthusiastic, yes, but dangerously unprepared.

Reviewers, whether in Accra, Abuja, or Freetown, are looking for three main things (Hulley et al.,
2013; PMID: 24071097):\
1. **Clarity** ‚Äî Do you know what you‚Äôre doing?\
2. **Feasibility** ‚Äî Can you realistically complete it as a resident with limited time and
resources?\
3. **Relevance** ‚Äî Will the findings matter for children in West Africa?

## Anatomy of a Proposal ‚Äì GCPS vs WACP

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. Both Colleges want the same essential elements: a strong
rationale, clear objectives, a robust methodology, and ethics. But the way they dress the bride is
slightly different.

-   **GCPS** is detailed and process-oriented. They want:
    1.  Title page
    2.  Abstract (500 words)
    3.  Table of contents
    4.  Introduction & rationale
    5.  Aims/objectives
    6.  Literature review (1500 words)
    7.  Materials and methods
    8.  Data management & analysis
    9.  Ethical/legal considerations
    10. Logistics, timeline, budget
    11. References
    12. Appendices
-   **WACP**, on the other hand, is concise and examiner-focused. They want:
    1.  Title page with detailed candidate/supervisor info
    2.  Introduction (‚â§300 words)
    3.  Literature review (‚â§1500 words)
    4.  Study design & methodology (‚â§1000 words)
    5.  Relevance (‚â§200 words)
    6.  References
    7.  Ethical approval
    8.  Verification page (with signatures)
    9.  Page for official use

If GCPS is like a buffet, with every dish laid out, WACP is like a finely plated gourmet meal:
smaller portions, but highly scrutinised.

## Breaking Down Key Sections

### Title

Should be **short, specific, and informative**. Avoid: *‚ÄúA Study of Malaria in Children.‚Äù* Instead:
*‚ÄúPrevalence and Risk Factors of Severe Malaria among Under-Five Children in Tamale Teaching
Hospital.‚Äù*

### Introduction & Rationale

This is your chance to show why your question matters. Set the stage with local data, link to global
literature, and highlight the gap. WACP allows 300 words; GCPS gives you more room, but don‚Äôt waste
it with unnecessary storytelling.

### Objectives & Research Questions

These must flow logically from your rationale. Examiners are allergic to vague objectives. Write
SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

Bad: *‚ÄúTo study anaemia in children.‚Äù*\
Good: *‚ÄúTo determine the prevalence and severity of anaemia among under-five children admitted at
Cape Coast Teaching Hospital between Jan and Dec 2025.‚Äù*

### Literature Review

This section is both your **credibility test** and your **GPS**. A well-done review shows you
understand what has been studied, where gaps remain, and how your project adds value. Both Colleges
insist on African literature. Use recent published sources but also cite local theses and regional
studies (Wong et al., 2021; PMID: 33486548).

### Methods

This is the beating heart of your proposal. Define:\
- Study design (cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, clinical trial)\
- Population, inclusion/exclusion criteria\
- Sampling strategy\
- Sample size (with justification; examiners love formulas!)\
- Data collection tools\
- Data management and analysis plan

A good rule: if someone else reads your methods, they should be able to repeat your study without
calling you at midnight.

### Ethics

Both Colleges want assurance that you will not traumatise children, breach confidentiality, or
overburden parents. Always name the ethics committee you applied to. Mention informed
consent/assent, confidentiality, and data protection.

### Relevance

WACP caps this at 200 words. Don‚Äôt just say *‚ÄúIt will help children.‚Äù* Be specific: *‚ÄúFindings will
guide policy on asthma management in Ghana and provide baseline data for future multicentre
studies.‚Äù*

### Budget, Timeline, and Logistics

Only GCPS explicitly requires these, but don‚Äôt ignore them for WACP. A Gantt chart is your best
friend. Supervisors love to see that you‚Äôve planned how to balance clinics, night calls, and
fieldwork.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

-   **Overambition**: ‚ÄúI will follow 10,000 children for 5 years.‚Äù My friend, you‚Äôll finish
    residency with white hair.
-   **Vague methods**: ‚ÄúData will be analysed.‚Äù How? With SPSS? STATA? Excel?
-   **Cut-and-paste literature review**: Examiners can spot plagiarism faster than children smell
    fried plantain.
-   **Ignoring ethics**: Nothing irritates examiners more.

## Example in Practice

Research question: *What is the prevalence of overweight and obesity among school-aged children in
Accra?*

Proposal structure:\
- **Title**: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Overweight and Obesity among Primary School Children in
Accra, Ghana.\
- **Introduction**: Childhood obesity is rising globally and in Africa (PMID: 36738719). Data from
Ghana is limited.\
- **Objectives**: To determine prevalence, identify associated factors, and compare urban vs
peri-urban schools.\
- **Literature Review**: Summarise Ghanaian studies and SSA prevalence rates.\
- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study, cluster sampling of schools, anthropometric measures, WHO BMI
z-scores, logistic regression.\
- **Ethics**: Parental consent, child assent, data anonymisation.\
- **Relevance**: Findings will inform school-based health interventions.\
- **Budget/Timeline**: Weighing scales, transport, data entry clerk, 9 months total.

## Summary

A proposal is more than paperwork. It is your **research promise** to your supervisors, your
College, and the children whose lives your findings may improve. Whether GCPS or WACP, examiners
want to see **clarity, feasibility, ethics, and relevance.**

## Take-Home Message

A strong proposal is a blend of curiosity, structure, and discipline. Ideas excite; proposals
convince. And in fellowship training, only the latter will get you across the finish line.

## Next Week on Paediatric Research Insights‚Ä¶

Now that we know the anatomy of a good proposal, next week we zoom into its beating heart: *‚ÄúWriting
the Introduction of the Proposal.‚Äù*

So polish your drafts, keep your supervisors caffeinated, and remember, a proposal is like cooking
jollof. Everyone swears theirs is the best, but only the one with the right ingredients, steps, and
timing avoids burning the pot. **See you next week!** üö∂üö∂üö∂

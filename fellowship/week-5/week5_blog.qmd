## Recap...

Last week we explored how to transform curiosity into a structured protocol by dissecting the
anatomy of a good research proposal. This week, we begin diving into the sections of the proposal,
starting with the Introduction.

## Introduction

If your research proposal were a blockbuster movie, the **Introduction** would be the *trailer*. It
provides the audience with just enough information to understand the plot, builds excitement, and
convinces them to purchase a ticket. Sadly, many residents either turn their introduction into a
**5-hour documentary on the disease itself** or a **30-second advertisement with no substance**.
Neither approach works.

The introduction is your opportunity to tell the examiners: *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the problem, here‚Äôs why it
matters, and here‚Äôs why my study is needed now.‚Äù* It sets the tone for the entire proposal and is
often the first part reviewers use to decide whether you truly understand your research question.

## Purpose of the Introduction

The introduction should:

1.  Provide the **context** for your study (what‚Äôs the bigger picture?)
2.  Clearly define the **research problem**.
3.  Highlight the **knowledge gap** you‚Äôre addressing.
4.  Lead naturally to your **objectives and hypotheses**.

Think of it as **funneling**: Start broad (background), narrow down (the specific problem), then
pinpoint (the gap your study will fill).

## What Makes a Good Introduction?

A good introduction is short, structured, and purposeful. It answers three silent questions in the
examiner‚Äôs mind:

1.  **What‚Äôs the context?**\
    *Why is this topic important in paediatrics, and especially in West Africa?*\
    **Example**: ‚ÄúGlobally, severe malaria is a leading cause of childhood deaths, with sub-Saharan
    Africa carrying the greatest burden.‚Äù

2.  **What‚Äôs the gap?**\
    *What‚Äôs missing in current knowledge or data?*\
    **Example**: ‚ÄúWhile numerous studies have described severe malaria mortality, predictors of
    death among children in Kumasi remain poorly characterized.‚Äù

3.  **Why now?**\
    *What makes your research timely and relevant?*\
    **Example**: ‚ÄúUnderstanding these predictors could inform triage and clinical management in
    resource-limited tertiary hospitals.‚Äù

## Common Pitfalls

-   **Overloading with facts**: Don‚Äôt copy-paste every malaria statistic since 1960.
-   **Storytelling without focus**: ‚ÄúIn 1880, Laveran discovered the malaria parasite‚Ä¶‚Äù. Examiners
    don‚Äôt need a history lesson.
-   **Vagueness**: Writing a whole page without once stating the research problem.

Here‚Äôs a real-life blooper from a resident: *‚ÄúAsthma is a disease. It is common in children. Many
children suffer from asthma. This study is about asthma.‚Äù* That got a firm ‚ÄúTry again!‚Äù from their
supervisor.

## Structure of a Good Introduction

Here‚Äôs a 4-paragraph model that works:

1.  **Background** ‚Äì Describe the global/regional/national context.
2.  **Local Relevance** ‚Äì Why does this problem matter in your setting?
3.  **Gap in Knowledge** ‚Äì What‚Äôs missing in the literature?
4.  **Research Problem Statement** ‚Äì Clearly state what your study aims to answer, thereby
    establishing your objectives.

## Tips for Success

-   **WACP candidates:** Keep within 300 words and articulate the problem, research questions,
    hypotheses, and objectives clearly.
-   **GCPS candidates:** You may have more room (300‚Äì500 words), but stay concise.
-   **Statistics:** Sprinkle them like salt; enough to enhance the taste, not too much to choke your
    reader.
-   **African Literature:** Always reference at least one local or regional study.
-   **Clarity:** Write simply. Examiners should feel *carried*, not *dragged*.

## A Sample Introduction...

**Title:** *Predictors of Mortality in Severe Malaria in Children Under Five Years in Kumasi, Ghana*

Malaria continues to be a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2022, an
estimated 247 million cases of malaria occurred globally, resulting in 619,000 deaths, with children
under five years accounting for nearly 80% of these deaths (WHO, 2023). Sub-Saharan Africa bears the
greatest burden, contributing approximately 94% of global malaria cases and deaths.

In Ghana, malaria remains the number one cause of outpatient attendance and childhood hospital
admissions, with under-five mortality rates still heavily influenced by this preventable disease.
Severe malaria, characterized by complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anaemia, and
respiratory distress, is associated with particularly high mortality when not promptly managed. At
Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, severe malaria cases are frequently admitted to
paediatric emergency and intensive care units, with outcomes varying depending on clinical and
laboratory factors.

Several studies across Africa have identified predictors of mortality in severe malaria, including
hypoglycaemia, delayed presentation, cerebral involvement, and co-morbid infections (Idro et al.,
2010; Olumese et al., 2019). However, there is limited data from Ghana, particularly in Kumasi, on
which factors most strongly predict mortality in children with severe malaria. Understanding these
predictors in the local context is essential for improving triage protocols, guiding resource
allocation, and ultimately reducing mortality.

This study, therefore, seeks to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality among
children under five years admitted with severe malaria at KATH. The findings will contribute
evidence to support more targeted interventions and enhance early recognition of high-risk patients
in Ghanaian hospitals.

Bingo!!! There you have it. üòéüòéüòé

## Take-Home Message

The introduction is your proposal‚Äôs trailer; clear, concise, and compelling. It should set the stage
by highlighting the context, narrowing down to the local problem, identifying the gap, and stating
the research problem. Avoid bloating it with unnecessary detail or starving it of meaning. If you
write your introduction well, you not only hook your examiners but also clarify your own research
focus. Think of it as setting the foundation for a house: shaky introductions lead to shaky
proposals.

## Next Week on Paediatric Research Insights‚Ä¶

Next week, we‚Äôll move from the *what* to the *why*: **‚ÄúWriting the Justification of the Proposal‚Äù**,
where you convince examiners that your research deserves attention, effort, and perhaps even
funding.

So, go forth and write introductions that sparkle like fresh kelewele at midnight, spicy enough to
get attention but not so overwhelming that no one can finish the plate. *See you next week!*

## Recap...

Last week, we discovered that the justification is the heartbeat of your proposal; the “*so what*”
that convinces examiners your study is worth their time and yours.

## Introduction

If your research proposal were a journey, the **objectives** would be your GPS. Without them, you
risk driving around the Takoradi Market Circle for hours without ever reaching your destination.
Objectives tell your examiners, your supervisor, and even your future self precisely what you plan
to achieve.

They are the bridge between your rationale (“why this study matters”) and your methodology (“how I
will do it”). In other words, the objectives take your grand ideas and translate them into clear,
measurable steps. Think of them as your thesis contract with the examiners: once approved, you’ll be
judged on whether you fulfilled them, no more, no less.

## Why Do Objectives Matter?

Objectives matter because they give structure and focus. Without them, your introduction and
justification may sound impressive but vague. With them, your study suddenly looks doable,
assessable, and relevant.

In both **WACP** and **GCPS** proposals, examiners expect objectives that are:

1.  **Clear** – No examiner wants to decode your intentions like a crossword puzzle.
2.  **Specific** – Avoid grand goals like *“eradicate malnutrition in Africa.”* Focus instead on
    *“assess prevalence of stunting in children under five at XYZ hospital.”*
3.  **Achievable** – Ambition is good, but remember: you are one resident, not WHO.
4.  **Relevant** – Tie them to your justification and problem statement.
5.  **Measurable** – Your data must be able to answer them.

## General vs. Specific Objectives

Residents often confuse the two, so let’s clear it up.

-   **General Objective:** The overall aim of the study. It captures the big picture. Think of it as
    the headline of your research intentions.
-   **Specific Objectives:** The smaller, precise steps that will help you achieve the general
    objective. They are like the bullet points under the headline.

**Example** (Severe malaria in Kumasi):

1.  *General Objective:* To determine predictors of mortality in children under five with severe
    malaria in Kumasi, Ghana.
2.  *Specific Objectives:*
    A.  To describe the clinical characteristics of children under five admitted with severe
        malaria.
    B.  To determine the case fatality rate of severe malaria in this population.
    C.  To identify clinical and laboratory factors associated with mortality.

Notice how each specific objective is measurable and leads logically to the overall aim.

## The SMART Approach

If in doubt, use the SMART checklist:

-   **S**pecific
-   **M**easurable
-   **A**chievable
-   **R**elevant
-   **T**ime-bound

Residents sometimes skip the “time-bound” part, but it matters. Examiners want assurance that you’re
not embarking on a lifelong PhD, but a focused fellowship thesis. A time anchor (e.g., “within a
12-month study period”) reassures them of feasibility.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1.  **Overcrowding:** Five or six objectives are too many. Stick to 3–4 specific ones. Otherwise,
    you risk spreading yourself too thin.
2.  **Vagueness:** Objectives like *“to study malaria in children”* are too broad. What about
    malaria? Incidence? Treatment outcomes? Mortality? Be precise.
3.  **Disconnection:** Sometimes, residents write objectives that don’t match their methods. If your
    methods can’t answer it, don’t write it.
4.  **Ambition Overload:** Remember, you’re not saving the entire health system. Avoid objectives
    that are unrealistic in scope.

## Example Objectives

**Topic:** Predictors of Mortality in Severe Malaria in Children Under Five Years in Kumasi, Ghana

-   *General Objective:*\
    To determine predictors of mortality among children under five admitted with severe malaria at
    Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.

-   *Specific Objectives:*

    1.  To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of children under five admitted with
        severe malaria.
    2.  To determine the proportion of children under five who die from severe malaria during
        hospitalization.
    3.  To identify clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality among these children.

Notice how each objective is precise, measurable, and feasible within the constraints of a
fellowship thesis.

## Take-Home Message

Clear, well-crafted objectives are the compass of your thesis. They translate your big idea into
achievable steps, reassure your examiners, and guide your methods and analysis. Keep them SMART,
limit them to a manageable number, and ensure they directly link to your justification. Remember:
objectives are not just for the examiners; they’re your personal guardrails against getting lost in
the wilderness of data.

## Next Week’s Prelude

Now that we’ve set the objectives, it’s time to tackle the cousin that examiners love to scrutinize:
**“Stating the Hypothesis.”** Get ready to learn why sometimes you need one, and sometimes you
don’t.

So...write your objectives as if you’re writing a shopping list: short, clear, and realistic. No one
goes to Kejetia market with a list that says *“buy happiness.”* *See you next week, and may your
objectives never be longer than your methods section!*
